# Task: Represent common single-variable mathematical functions in Python.

# 1. Define a function called linear_function that represents the linear function f(x) = 2x+3.



# 2. Define a function called constant_function that represents the constant function g(x) = 4.



# 3. Define a function called exponential_function that represents the exponential function h(x) = 2^x.



# 4. Use a built-in command to define a function called absolute_value that represents the absolute value function k(x)=|x|.
