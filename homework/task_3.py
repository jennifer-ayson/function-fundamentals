# Task: Represent functions with non-numerical parameters.

# 1. Define a function called first_element that takes in a list and outputs its first element.
def first_element(list):
  return list[0]

# 2. Define a function called last_element that takes in a list and outputs its last element.
def last_element(list):
 return list[-1]


# 3. Define a function called first_last_sum that takes in a list and outputs the sum of
# the first and last element. The function should call the functions in tasks 1-2.
def first_last_sum(list):
  sum = list[0] + list[-1]
  return sum


# 4. Define a function called distance_from_origin that takes in a tuple representing a point
# in the xy-coordinate plane and outputs its distance from the origin.
# Hint: Learn how to "unpack" a tuple input.
def distance_from_origin 


# 5. Define a function called distance_between that takes in two tuples representing points
# in the xy-coordinate plane and outputs their distance from each other.
# Hint: "Unpack" each input tuple.
